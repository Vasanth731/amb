    <h1>History</h1>
    <p>
      History is the study of past events, particularly in human affairs. Through examining documents,
      artifacts, and oral traditions, historians piece together narratives of how civilizations rose and
      fell, how ideas spread and evolved, and how the actions of individuals and groups shaped the world.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Understanding history helps us comprehend present circumstances, learn from past mistakes, and make
      informed decisions about the future. It reveals patterns of human behavior, social change, and the
      forces that drive civilizations forward or lead to their decline.
