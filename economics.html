    <h1>Economics</h1>
    <p>
      Economics studies how individuals, businesses, governments, and nations make choices about allocating
      scarce resources. It examines production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, and the
      systems through which societies organize economic activity.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Microeconomics focuses on individual decision-making and market mechanisms, while macroeconomics
      examines economy-wide phenomena like inflation, unemployment, and economic growth. Economics helps
      us understand incentives, trade-offs, and the forces shaping prosperity and inequality.
