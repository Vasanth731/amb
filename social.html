    <h1>Social Science</h1>
    <p>
      Social sciences are academic disciplines that study human society and social relationships. They examine
      how individuals and groups interact, how societies are organized, how cultures develop, and how human
      behavior is shaped by social structures and institutions.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Through systematic research and analysis, social sciences help us understand patterns of human behavior,
      cultural diversity, economic systems, political structures, and the complex web of interactions that
      define human civilization.
