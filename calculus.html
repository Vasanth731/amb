    <h1>Calculus</h1>
    <p>
      Calculus is the mathematical study of continuous change. It provides tools for modeling and analyzing
      dynamic systems, rates of change, and accumulation. Developed independently by Newton and Leibniz in
      the 17th century, calculus revolutionized mathematics and science.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      The two main branches are differential calculus (studying rates of change and slopes of curves) and
      integral calculus (studying accumulation of quantities and areas under curves). Together, they form
      the foundation for physics, engineering, economics, and many other fields.
