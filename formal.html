    <h1>Formal Science</h1>
    <p>
      Formal sciences are branches of knowledge concerned with formal systems, such as logic, mathematics,
      theoretical computer science, information theory, and statistics. Unlike other sciences, formal sciences
      are not concerned with the validity of theories based on observations in the physical world, but instead
      with the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Mathematics is the language of patterns, structures, and relationships. It provides the foundational
      framework for understanding the universe through abstract reasoning and logical deduction.
