    <h1>Anthropology</h1>
    <p>
      Anthropology is the holistic study of humanity, examining human biological evolution, cultural diversity,
      language, and social structures across time and space. It seeks to understand what makes us human and
      how human societies have developed and changed throughout history.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Cultural anthropology studies living cultures and societies, archaeology examines past civilizations
      through material remains, biological anthropology explores human evolution and physical variation, and
      linguistic anthropology investigates the role of language in human life.
