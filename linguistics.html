    <h1>Linguistics</h1>
    <p>
      Linguistics is the scientific study of language and its structure. It examines how languages are formed,
      how they change over time, how they are processed by the human brain, and how they are used in social
      contexts. Language is uniquely human and fundamental to culture and thought.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Phonetics studies speech sounds, syntax examines sentence structure, semantics explores meaning, and
      sociolinguistics investigates how language varies across communities. Linguistics reveals the universal
      principles underlying all human languages and the diversity of linguistic expression.
