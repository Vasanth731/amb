    <h1>Theology</h1>

    <h2>My Perspective</h2>
    <p>
      Theology for me is to study the perspective of people who thought they knew God. First of all we are a Creation and a created brain cannot comprehend the Creator but we can try.
    </p>

    <h2>Christianity</h2>
    <p>
      The oldest of the writings are the Dead Sea Scrolls which tell about how the Hebrews interpreted the Creator. It starts with God creating his creation which is dynamic in space-time-matter. Through Adam came the fall, followed for generations through Noah and his kids. Still after the great flood there was transgressions. Then came Abraham through Terah in the line of Shem. Where God calls him to follow him and he does. Then comes Issac, Jacob and his 12 children and Joseph one among them becoming the right hand of Pharaoh saving them but it eventually leads to captivity of later generations. Then through Moses the exodus takes place, then the nation of Israel is made and led through Judges, Prophets, Kings. All this took place to pave the way for the Messiah, who is Christ Jesus, the very word of God who became Flesh, who fullfilled the prophesies and lived a perfect life and died to save the humankind and rose again to show us the end times. After he ascended into heaven, his followers spread out to spread this good news and eventually became martyrs. They formed the 5 main churches which are Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, Constantinople, and Rome being the center in command and the missionary dimension of church led to many other churches all around the world. Later few people disolved the full essence of church teachings and started following those ideas few of which are the denominations and other socio-economic systems.

    <h2>Judaism</h2>
    <p>
      Oldest Abrahamic faith (~2000 BCE), covenant between monotheistic God (YHWH) and Abraham's descendants, formalized via Moses' Torah at Sinai. Core: Shema ("Hear O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One"), 613 mitzvot (commandments) on ethics, ritual, justice. Texts: Tanakh (Torah/Pentateuch, Nevi'im Prophets, Ketuvim Writings), Oral Torah (Mishnah, Talmud). Branches: Orthodox (halakha strict), Conservative (adaptive), Reform (ethical focus), Reconstructionist (cultural). Life cycle: brit milah (circumcision), bar/bat mitzvah (adulthood), marriage (ketubah), mourning (shivah). Shabbat (Sabbath) rest, kosher diet, holidays: Rosh Hashanah (New Year), Yom Kippur (atonement), Passover (exodus), Hanukkah (lights). Synagogues, rabbis teach; Zionism led to Israel 1948 post-Holocaust. Diaspora resilience, tikkun olam (repair world). Prophets emphasize justice (Micah: "do justice, love mercy"). Kabbalah mysticism (Zohar). ~15 million, influences Christianity/Islam.
    </p>

    <h2>Islam</h2>
    <p>
      Islam originated in 7th-century Arabia with Prophet Muhammad, who received revelations from Allah via the angel Gabriel, compiled in the Quran as the final, unaltered scripture. It affirms Tawhid (absolute monotheism), belief in angels, holy books (Torah, Psalms, Gospel, Quran), prophets from Adam to Muhammad, Judgment Day, and divine predestination (qadar). Muhammad's life (sira) and sayings (hadith) guide alongside the Quran; the Sunni-Shia split arose over succession, with Sunnis following caliphs and Shias imams. Islam's Golden Age (8th-13th centuries) advanced science, math (algebra), medicine, and astronomy, preserving Greek texts and enabling space prayer adaptations, like for astronaut Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor. Practices center on the Five Pillars: Shahada (declaring faith: "There is no god but Allah, Muhammad is His messenger"), Salah (five daily prayers facing Mecca's Kaaba), Zakat (2.5% annual alms), Sawm (Ramadan fasting), and Hajj (pilgrimage if able). Sharia (Islamic law) from Quran, hadith, consensus (ijma), and analogy (qiyas) governs ethics, family, and society. Sufism emphasizes mysticism and direct divine experience via dhikr. Islam spread rapidly post-Muhammad's 632 death, via conquests, trade, and da'wah, reaching Spain, India, Africa; today ~1.9 billion adherents, diverse sects like Ibadi, Ahmadiyya. Jihad means striving, including personal and defensive struggle. Mosques host prayer; festivals include Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha. Women roles vary culturally but Quran affirms equality in spirituality.

    <h2>Hinduism</h2>
    <p>
      Hinduism, sans a single founder, evolved over millennia in India from Vedic traditions (~1500 BCE), encompassing diverse philosophies, rituals, sects. Core: Brahman (ultimate reality), atman (soul), karma (action consequences), samsara (rebirth cycle), moksha (liberation). Deities include Trimurti—Brahma (creator), Vishnu (preserver, avatars like Rama, Krishna), Shiva (destroyer/transformer)—plus Devi (goddess). Texts: Vedas (Rig, Sama, Yajur, Atharva) hymns/rituals; Upanishads philosophical; epics Mahabharata (Bhagavad Gita: duty, devotion, knowledge paths), Ramayana; Puranas myths. Four purusharthas: dharma (cosmic order/duty), artha (prosperity), kama (pleasure), moksha. Varna (priests, warriors, merchants, laborers) and jati (castes) structure society, though fluid historically. Yoga paths: Jnana (knowledge), Bhakti (devotion), Karma (action), Raja (meditation). Worship via puja (offerings) at home/mandirs, festivals like Diwali (light victory), Holi (spring), pilgrimage to Ganges, Kumbh Mela. Ahimsa (nonviolence) influences vegetarianism, Gandhi. Sects: Vaishnavism (Vishnu), Shaivism (Shiva), Shaktism. Modern reforms by Vivekananda, Gandhi emphasize unity ("truth is one, sages call it by many names"). ~1.2 billion followers, mostly India; diaspora adapts while preserving traditions.
    </p>

    <h2>Buddhism</h2>
    <p>
      Founded ~5th century BCE by Siddhartha Gautama (Buddha, "Enlightened One") in India, rejecting caste/Vedic ritual for direct insight into suffering. Four Noble Truths: dukkha (suffering/unsatisfactoriness), samudaya (origin: craving/ignorance), nirodha (cessation), magga (path: Noble Eightfold—right view, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration). Three Marks: impermanence (anicca), suffering (dukkha), no-self (anatta). Threefold training: sila (ethics), samadhi (concentration), panna (wisdom). Goal: nirvana, ending samsara. Theravada ("elders," Sri Lanka, SE Asia) stresses arhat ideal, Pali Canon; Mahayana ("great vehicle," China, Japan, Tibet) bodhisattva vow delaying nirvana to help others, texts like Lotus Sutra, Heart Sutra; Vajrayana (Tibetan) tantric methods. Meditation: vipassana (insight), samatha (calm). Sangha (monastic community), precepts (5 for lay: no killing, stealing, misconduct, lying, intoxicants). Festivals: Vesak (Buddha's birth/enlightenment/parinirvana). Spread via Ashoka (3rd BCE), Silk Road; adapts culturally (Zen minimalism, Pure Land faith). Dalai Lama embodies compassion. ~500 million, emphasizes mindfulness influencing West.
    </p>

    <h2>African Traditional Religions</h2>
    <p>
      Encompassing indigenous African traditions scattered via transatlantic slave trade (1500s-1800s), blending with Islam/Christianity into Vodou (Haiti), Santería/Candomblé (Cuba/Brazil), Orisa-Vodun (US). Cosmology: three realms—spirit (gods like Yoruba orisa/Olorun supreme), human, underworld (ancestors)—interconnected, reciprocal via rituals/offerings for harmony, rain, guidance. Yoruba example: orisa (deities like Shango thunder, Yemaya sea) honored; Egungun festivals invoke ancestors with masks, dance. Islam/Christianity predate colonialism in Africa (Ethiopian Orthodox 300s, West African Islam 700s via trade). Adaptations: enslaved hid practices under saints (e.g., Vodou lwa). Rituals: sacrifices, buna qalaa (Oromo coffee for Waaqa), elaborate coffins (Ga), initiations (Nandi bravery). Creation: Bambara "yo" sound births all; Basari fruit explains languages. Festivals, drumming foster community. Flexible, overlapping—emphasize ancestry, nature. Sparked revolutions (Haiti 1791 Vodou ceremony). Millions practice globally, preserving identity.
    </p>

    <h2>Chinese Religion</h2>
    <p>
      No singular "religion" but syncretic "Three Teachings": Confucianism (ethics, harmony), Daoism (nature flow), Buddhism (integrated), folk practices. Confucianism (~551 BCE Kong Fuzi): ren (benevolence), li (ritual propriety), xiao (filial piety), junzi (gentleman) via Analects; state ideology emphasizing hierarchy, education, Mencius/Neo-Confucianism. Daoism (Laozi's Daodejing ~6th BCE): Dao (way), wu wei (effortless action), yin-yang balance, ziran (spontaneity); immortality elixirs, feng shui. Chinese Buddhism (Han dynasty): Chan (Zen) meditation, Pure Land devotion. Folk: ancestor veneration, deities (Jade Emperor), festivals (Chinese New Year, Qingming). Temples blend icons; imperial exams Confucian. Mao era suppressed, post-1978 revival. ~1.4 billion influenced, pragmatic—practice multiple without contradiction.
    </p>

    <h2>Shinto</h2>
    <p>
      Shinto is Japan's indigenous spiritual tradition, often called "the way of the kami," referring to spirits or divine essences inhabiting nature, ancestors, and sacred objects, without a single founder, sacred text, or rigid dogma. Emerging over millennia from ancient animistic practices, it emphasizes harmony (wa) with the natural world, purity (both physical and spiritual), family continuity, and communal rituals to maintain balance against disruptive forces like evil spirits. Kami—countless, from major deities like Amaterasu (sun goddess and imperial ancestor) to localized tree or river spirits—are venerated at shrines (jinja) through purification rites (misogi, like hand-washing at entrances), offerings of rice wine or food, prayers clapped twice with bows, and festivals (matsuri) featuring dances, parades, and fireworks to ensure prosperity, fertility, and protection. Daily life integrates Shinto via home altars (kamidana), seasonal celebrations like New Year's (hatsumode) shrine visits, and life events such as weddings, though funerals often blend with Buddhism. Core affirmations include love of pristine nature (mountains as sacred), ritual cleanliness to ward impurities, upholding ancestral traditions through genealogy reverence, and sincere heart (magokoro) in actions—humans are seen as innately good, with no absolute good/evil binary. State Shinto (1868-1945) tied it to nationalism and emperor divinity, but post-WWII it reverted to folk practice, syncretizing freely with Buddhism, Confucianism, and modern life. Today, over 80,000 shrines serve Japan's population, fostering optimism, ecological respect, and group subordination over individualism; its fluidity allows most Japanese to participate culturally without exclusive affiliation.
    </p>

    <h2>Atheism</h2>
    <p>
      Atheism, while not a religion but a philosophical stance rejecting belief in deities or supernatural forces, merits discussion here as a worldview often contrasted with faiths in educational series like Crash Course, emphasizing empirical evidence, reason, and humanism. Rooted in ancient thinkers like Epicurus or Charvaka but surging in the Enlightenment (Voltaire, Hume critiquing miracles), 19th-century works (Nietzsche's "God is dead"), and modern science (Darwin's evolution, cosmology), it posits no gods exist due to lack of verifiable proof—burden of proof lies on claimants of the extraordinary. Varieties include "strong" atheism (active denial of gods' existence), "weak" (mere absence of belief), agnostic atheism (uncertainty plus non-belief), and antitheism (opposing religion's harms). Key principles: reliance on scientific method, skepticism toward dogma, ethical frameworks from secular humanism (e.g., Universal Declaration of Human Rights), promoting well-being via reason, empathy, and rights without divine commands. Figures like Dawkins ("The God Delusion") argue religions hinder progress; Sartre highlighted existential freedom—humans create meaning sans cosmic purpose. Globally, ~7-13% identify as atheists/agnostics (higher in China, Czechia, Sweden), spurred by education, scandals, and internet discourse; organizations like American Atheists or Humanists International advocate separation of church/state. Criticisms include perceived moral relativism (countered by evolutionary ethics, reciprocity), but atheists cite lower religiosity correlating with societal stability in metrics like happiness, low crime. Holidays? None formal, but some celebrate Darwin Day or Reason Rally. In diverse societies, atheism fosters pluralism, urging religions toward reform while navigating tensions like blasphemy laws.
