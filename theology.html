    <h1>Theology</h1>
    <p>
      Theology is the systematic study of the nature of the divine, religious beliefs, and spiritual practices.
      It explores questions about God, faith, revelation, salvation, and humanity's relationship with the
      sacred. Through reason, scripture, and tradition, theology seeks to understand ultimate reality.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Different religious traditions have their own theological frameworks, from Christian theology exploring
      the Trinity and incarnation, to Islamic theology examining tawhid (divine unity), to Buddhist philosophy
      contemplating enlightenment. Theology addresses the deepest questions of existence, meaning, and purpose.
