    <h1>Geography</h1>
    <p>
      Geography is the study of places, the relationships between people and their environments, and the
      spatial patterns of physical and human phenomena. It bridges natural and social sciences, examining
      how landscapes, climates, and resources shape human settlements and activities.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Physical geography studies natural features like mountains, rivers, and climates, while human geography
      examines population distribution, urbanization, and cultural landscapes. Together, they help us understand
      how humans interact with and transform the Earth.
