    <h1>Civics</h1>
    <p>
      Civics is the study of the rights and duties of citizenship, government institutions, and political
      processes. It examines how citizens participate in public life, how governments function, and the
      principles underlying democratic systems and the rule of law.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 20px;">
      Understanding civics is essential for active citizenship, enabling people to engage meaningfully with
      their government, exercise their rights responsibly, and contribute to the democratic process. It
      explores constitutions, voting systems, civil liberties, and civic responsibilities.
